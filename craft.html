			<h2>Craft Skills:The beginning</h2>
			<p>The craft skills module is the module ran every Monday morning that gives us the knowledge and foundation skills to become good and effective filmmakers.For the first few weeks we were given the freedom to go out with equipment such as the canon c100 and Nikon DSLR stills camera and experiment with them, just began to enjoy and become well educated and skilled with the equipment without having to many creative restrictions.
			<br>
			<br>
			Personally I really enjoyed the first month of craft skills experimenting with the equipment. Today we were given the brief for a short three minute film we are to make. We were split Into groups and need to find a single monologue sequence then film shots and sound to go alongside this monologue and it needs to be three minute in duration. having the restrictions of just using a monologue I believe will be challenging but someone I will enjoy. ​​​​​​​</p>
