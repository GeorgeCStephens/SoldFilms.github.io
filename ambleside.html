			<h2>Preperation</h2>
			<p>In preparation for the Ambleside trip we had to start the creation of a production file, it was important that we created pre production documents to go into the production file before we got Ambleside because as  crew we need to have documents signed such as location release form, contributor release forms before we film as these are legal requirements. We had just under a month from starting the course to getting on the bus to Ambleside so it was quite a tight time frame to complete the pre production documents in preparation for the trip.</p>

			<h2>Day 1</h2>
			<p>As the bus left from the the film theatre at 7:15am Crew O was very tired but glad that all the pre production documents had to be completed and were ready for the trip, Once we arrived we had just over four hours to go explore Ambleside, get locations and get a contributor for the film. This task was very difficult and there was some struggles getting contributors as a lot of people were not willing to give us their time for us to film them which is understandable. After two hours of looking as a group we finally found a contributor for the film, The rattle Gill Cafe within Ambleside.</p>

			<h2>Day 2</h2>
			<p>The second Day at Ambleside was our first day on set filming, we arrived at the cafe at 10am where we began the filming at 10:30, we began the day shooting with the interview as we thought this would be the most important section of the film. The interview took about 45 minutes to film as we had many questions to ask her. In terms of my experience with filming the interview it was quite difficult, I was interviewing Clare and asking her the questions which at times I found quite hard and struggled to get my questions across however it was all a learning curve and will hopefully make me better and more confident at interviewing contributors in the future. After filming the interview we went on to film B roll within the cafe before thanking Clare for her hospitality for the days filming and leaving to go and check our footage. After a review of our footage we decided that we needed more B roll and a lot more audio sounds to match with the footage as only half of the films duration is allowed to the contributor talking.</p>

			<h2>Day 3</h2>
			<p>The second day of filming and last night at Ambleside consisted of getting the remaining shots that we needed for the B roll footage and a lot more audio sounds within the Cafe as well as looking for potential B roll shots within Ambleside to convey the area which the cafe is in within the film, the third day of filming was successful and we returned to the hostel happy with the footage we had filmed.

			<h2>The Editing Phase</h2>
			<p>Now that we had shot all of our footage for the film we returned back to university where we will now begin the editing phase. Currently we are two weeks into the phase and we have had two meeting with our peer advisor Andy and have a Assemble edit together for the basic layout of the film.
